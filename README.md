# React useEffect and Data Fetching

## Learning Goals

- Learn what a side effect is

- Learn the syntax for the useEffect hook

- Incorporate useEffect for a primary GET request to fill state

- Learn how to use the useEffect dependency array to control when it triggers

- Learn how to make a post request to add additional data

## Tools

Begin with `npm install` and `npm start`

In a seperate terminal tab you can run the json-server with `npm run server`. This works because we added a new script called `server` in our `package.json'.

Your endpoints are `http://localhost:3002/raccoons` and `http://localhost:3002/comics`.
