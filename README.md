# React PATCH and DELETE

## Learning Goals

- Go over the PATCH fetch method

- Use `.map` in order to replace objects in an array in state

- Go over the DELETE fetch method

- Use `.filter` to remove objects in an array in state

## Tools

Begin with `npm install` and `npm start`

In a seperate terminal tab you can run the json-server with `npm run server`. This works because we added a new script called `server` in our `package.json'.

Your endpoint is `http://localhost:3002/raccoons`.
